## Purpose
A node.js team profile generator that generates an HTML that displays the user input in styled cards on the HTML page. The user is prompted with many questions that are specific to the team member, manager, engineer, and intern. There can be as many engineers and interns as the user desires. The code was tested with npm jest for functionality and also uses npm inquirer for the various types of prompts.
